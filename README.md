# Twitch Creep
This is a twitch app Iâ€™m working on.  It can display what streamers you follow, featured games, or search by game.

To do this I'm using the twitch api: https://github.com/justintv/twitch-api

This is my first time building an application with QT, so a lot of the code is messy and experimental.  Comments and criticism appreciated!

##Suported Platforms:
Windows

Mac OSX (10.8+)

Linux support to come (untested)
